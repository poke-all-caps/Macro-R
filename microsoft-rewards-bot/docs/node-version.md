# Node.js Version

Navigation: [Documentation index](./README.md) · [Install & auto-updates](./updates.md) · [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)

Use **Node.js 24.15.0**.

The accepted version is:

```text
24.15.0
```

The bot checks this before `npm start`, `npm run dev`, and `npm run ts-start`.

## Check Your Version

```powershell
node -v
npm run node:check
```

If the check fails, install Node.js 24.15.0, then reinstall dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

## Why This Is Strict

The official Core plugin is runtime-targeted. Running it on another Node.js version or another runtime target can fail at runtime or behave unpredictably.

Core currently ships for Windows x64, Linux x64, Linux ARM64, and Intel macOS x64 on Node.js `24.15.0`. Apple Silicon requires running the x64 Node.js runtime through Rosetta until a native `darwin-arm64` build is produced and tested.

For this reason, the official release refuses every Node.js version except 24.15.0 before loading the bot.

## Common Fix on Windows

If `npm start` reports another version, install Node.js 24.15.0 globally, then open a new PowerShell window:

```powershell
node -v
npm install
npm start
```

If Windows still reports the old version, check that `C:\Program Files\nodejs` is first in your Node path and remove the newer Node.js installation from Windows Apps or Programs and Features.

## Security Note

Core is distributed as a verified, compiled plugin; no server secrets are shipped inside it.
