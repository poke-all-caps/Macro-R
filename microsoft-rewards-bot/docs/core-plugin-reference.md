# Core Plugin Technical Reference

Navigation: [Documentation index](./README.md) · [Official Core plugin](./core-plugin.md) · [Core Dashboard](./dashboard.md)

This page documents how the official Core plugin behaves, what it covers, and how it is published. For the public-facing overview, see [Official Core plugin](./core-plugin.md).

## Distribution Model

The public bot repository is source-available, but the official Core plugin is proprietary and requires a paid license.

Core is preinstalled in `plugins/core` and shipped as a compiled official artifact. The
bot verifies that this artifact is authentic before Core is granted any privileged access.
If that verification does not pass, premium Core features simply stay off.

## Coverage Model

The public edition focuses on the stable Rewards workflow:

- Bing searches;
- limited Daily Set processing;
- simple URL rewards;
- quizzes.

Core adds the maintained premium layer for newer or faster-changing dashboard surfaces:

- claimable point cards;
- dashboard coupon detection and application;
- app rewards;
- streak details;
- streak protection sync;
- best-effort handling for temporary quest and punchcard pages under `/earn/quest/...`;
- advanced side-panel automation;
- final Discord/Ntfy run summaries with Core impact metrics;
- the official remote dashboard.

## Dashboard Applicability (Classic ASP vs New Next.js)

Microsoft serves two Rewards dashboards and the variant is detected per account, per
device, at login. The bot runs the correct path automatically — no configuration. A
feature carries the **same tier on both dashboards** (free stays free, Core stays Core);
only the *implementation* differs, and a few features simply do not exist on the classic
dashboard because Microsoft never offered them there.

| Capability | Tier | Classic (ASP) | New (Next.js) |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| Bing searches, Daily Set, More/Special, UrlReward, Quiz, FindClippy | Free | ✓ account endpoints (`api/reportactivity`, `bingqa`) | ✓ React Server Actions |
| Classic punch cards | Free | ✓ (often *more* earnable activities here) | — none served (clean no-op) |
| Claim points | Core | ✓ `api/claimallpointsasync` | ✓ dashboard claim panel |
| Daily streak (read) | Core | ✓ from dashboard JSON | ✓ from dashboard DOM/RSC |
| Streak protection (sync) | Core | ✓ `api/togglestreakasync` | ✓ dashboard streak panel |
| Double search points | Core | ✓ `api/reportactivity` | ✓ server action |
| App rewards / Daily check-in / Read to earn | Core | ✓ (account endpoints, shape-agnostic) | ✓ |
| Dashboard info | Core | ✓ minimal snapshot from JSON | ✓ rich snapshot from DOM/RSC |
| Apply coupons | Core | — not offered on classic (no-op) | ✓ |
| Set Rewards goal | Core | — not offered on classic (no-op) | ✓ |
| Temporary punchcards (quests) | Core | — not offered on classic (no-op) | ✓ best effort |

Features marked **“not offered on classic”** are Microsoft new-dashboard surfaces
(coupons, goals, limited-time quest punchcards). On a classic account they are inert by
design: Core detects the legacy variant and skips them silently rather than erroring. In
the Rewards Desk these toggles carry a **“Next only”** badge, and their estimated points
are not credited to accounts forced to the legacy dashboard.

When Microsoft finishes migrating everyone to the new dashboard, the classic column
disappears with no behavior change for users — the bot simply stays on the new path.

## Claimable Points And Coupons

Core handles two dashboard side-panel flows:

| Surface | Detection | Action | Result tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ready-to-claim points | Rewards dashboard card with a points value greater than zero | Opens the claim panel and clicks `Claim points` | Claimed point total and entry count |
| Coupons | Dashboard control text like `Coupon (1)` or `Coupons (N)` | Opens the coupons panel, skips cards already marked `Applied`, and clicks visible apply actions when needed | Coupon count, title, expiry text, and estimated point discount |

Selectors are DOM-driven because Microsoft does not expose a stable public API for these React Aria side panels. Core prefers visible button text, ARIA/dialog scope, and observed Rewards utility classes over dynamic React-generated ids.

Coupon discounts are not normal point earnings. The run summary reports them separately as estimated coupon-discount points instead of adding them to the collected-points balance. If the coupon title is available, the summary includes it so users can see what Core handled.

## Dashboard Card Categories

Not every card shown on the Microsoft Rewards dashboard is a direct point task.

| Card type | Typical behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Standard web activity | Can often be completed directly |
| Search-triggered activity | May require an eligible Bing query |
| Temporary quest / punchcard | Best effort when the page follows a supported pattern |
| Passive progress card | Tracked by Microsoft account state |
| App-only or install task | Reported or skipped |
| Subscription, redeem, or sweepstakes offer | Reported or skipped |

Examples of passive or external items include level-up streaks, default-search progress, installing Edge, installing an extension, using the Bing or Xbox app, redeeming points, subscribing to Game Pass, or entering a sweepstakes.

## Temporary Punchcards

Temporary punchcards are campaign-specific. Core handles the common supported pattern when possible:

1. open the quest page;
2. activate the punchcard if Microsoft exposes an activation action;
3. complete supported `bing.com/search` or simple URL steps;
4. leave redeem, install, subscription, app-only, and time-gated steps as external.

This lets Core support recurring campaign structures without hardcoding every short-lived promotion.

## Dashboard Behavior

Core includes the official remote dashboard and background agent. It starts after a successful license check and opens only an outbound connection to the official dashboard service. It does not expose a local HTTP server or bind to the user's local network.

Users sign in on the official dashboard domain with:

1. their Core license key;
2. Discord OAuth.

The dashboard shows masked account status, run state, recent filtered logs, point summaries, version/update state, auto-start status, diagnostics, and allowlisted actions such as starting a run when the bot is idle.

Dashboard commands are queued and acknowledged asynchronously, so a short delay after an action is expected. Live state such as heartbeats, snapshots, logs, and command state is kept by the official backend service for fast updates, while license/auth state and durable audit records for mutations are stored separately by that same service.

Devices remain visible after going offline so users can inspect the last known state. Deleting a device from the dashboard removes live dashboard state only and does not revoke the license activation.

Sensitive account/config changes are sent as commands that are signed and verified before they run. The dashboard protects the command for the selected device, the official backend simply relays it, and your local bot verifies it before writing any local files.

Maintainers can override the service URL for custom deployments:

```jsonc
"core": {
  "enabled": true,
  "priority": 100,
  "config": {
    "dashboardUrl": "https://bot.lgtw.tf"
  }
}
```

## License Validation

Core validates licenses against the official backend service. Everything it needs to talk to that service is already built into the official release, so you never have to configure any backend access yourself — just activate your license and Core does the rest.

## Security Boundary

The public plugin API cannot grant official Core entitlement and cannot register premium Core tasks. Only the official compiled Core artifact can unlock those paths in the official release.

Because the source-available repository is modifiable, a local copy can remove local limits from its own files. The license does not permit public redistribution of changes that bypass, unlock, replace, emulate, or reproduce Core. Core remains a paid proprietary plugin.

Anything that really matters for security — license checks, entitlements, and audit records — is decided by the official backend service, not by files on your machine. That keeps the system trustworthy even though the rest of the bot is open.

The official Core build is provided per platform. Core support on Windows, Linux, Docker, and ARM64 depends on having the matching official build installed (see [Node.js version](./node-version.md)).

## Authenticity And Integrity

You do not have to do anything special to keep Core trustworthy — the bot handles it for you. Each official Core build is verified as authentic before it is allowed any privileged access, and only an official build can unlock premium Core features. If a build is missing, modified, or does not match what the bot expects, Core simply stays inactive and the bot keeps running in free, open-source mode.
