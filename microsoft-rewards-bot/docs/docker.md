# Docker

Navigation: [Documentation index](./README.md) · [Node.js version](./node-version.md) · [Official Core plugin](./core-plugin.md) · [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)

Docker is supported for the public bot and the official Core plugin on the official image target:

- Debian 12 Bookworm, from `node:24.15.0-slim`
- Node.js `24.15.0`
- Linux `x64`

Core is optional. If you do not have a Core license, disable it in `plugins/plugins.jsonc` or start the container without `LICENSE_KEY`; the public bot still runs.

Docker images do not self-update. At startup, the bot checks GitHub and logs a warning if a newer version exists. Pull or rebuild the image to update.

## Build and Run (Compose)

From the repository root, using the provided `compose.yaml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This is the recommended way to build and run the bot. The Dockerfile builds the TypeScript app, installs production dependencies, installs the browser runtime, and copies `plugins/` into the final image.

## Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  msrb:
    build:
      context: .
      extra_hosts:
        - "cdn.playwright.dev:${PLAYWRIGHT_CDN_IP:-150.171.109.20}"
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    environment:
      CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 2 * * *"
      RUN_ON_START: "true"
      TZ: "UTC"
      LICENSE_KEY: "MSRB-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
    volumes:
      - ./src/accounts.json:/usr/src/microsoft-rewards-bot/dist/accounts.json:ro
      - ./src/config.json:/usr/src/microsoft-rewards-bot/dist/config.json:ro
      - ./plugins/plugins.jsonc:/usr/src/microsoft-rewards-bot/plugins/plugins.jsonc:ro
      - ./sessions:/usr/src/microsoft-rewards-bot/sessions
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The `extra_hosts` entry works around a Docker Desktop bug where its internal DNS proxy fails to resolve `cdn.playwright.dev` (used to download the Chromium build during `docker build`), causing `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN` errors. It's harmless on setups that aren't affected. If the build ever fails with that error and this IP has gone stale, refresh it with `nslookup cdn.playwright.dev 1.1.1.1`, then either update the default in the file or override it without editing anything via `PLAYWRIGHT_CDN_IP=<new-ip> docker compose build`.

The `dns` entry works around the same Docker Desktop DNS proxy bug showing up at runtime instead of build time — the bot calls out to several Microsoft/webhook domains during a run (`edgeupdates.microsoft.com`, etc.), and on affected setups those lookups fail with `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN` too. Pointing the container at public DNS resolvers sidesteps Docker's internal proxy entirely. It's harmless on setups that aren't affected.

The long-term recommended scheduler is the built-in Node scheduler in `src/config.json`. The cron entrypoint remains supported for existing Docker installs.

## Build and Run (plain Docker, without Compose)

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t microsoft-rewards-bot .
docker run --rm \
  -e CRON_SCHEDULE="0 2 * * *" \
  -e RUN_ON_START=true \
  -e TZ=UTC \
  -e LICENSE_KEY="MSRB-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX" \
  microsoft-rewards-bot
```

For Core in Docker, `LICENSE_KEY` is the non-interactive license input. Without it, Core disables itself and the bot continues in public mode.

If `docker build` fails with `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN cdn.playwright.dev` (a known Docker Desktop DNS proxy bug — see the Compose section above), either switch to `docker compose build`, or add `--add-host=cdn.playwright.dev:150.171.109.20` to the `docker build -f docker/Dockerfile` command.

## Core Runtime Compatibility

The official Core plugin must match the runtime target. The supported Docker target is Node.js `24.15.0` on Linux `x64`.

Maintainers must publish an official Core artifact for the Docker target. If that target is missing, Core disables or fails before browser automation starts.

If Core reports an incompatible runtime artifact, the container is not running the official Node/platform target.

If Core fails before browser automation starts, do not add random Debian packages. Use the official Dockerfile target and an official Core release built for Linux `x64`.

## Runtime Packages

The runtime stage installs:

- `cron`, `gettext-base`, `tzdata`, `ca-certificates`
- Chromium headless system libraries required by Patchright
- the app production `node_modules`
- `plugins/`, including `plugins/core`
- `node_modules/microsoft-rewards-bot`, used by the official Core runtime

Do not remove `plugins/` or `node_modules/microsoft-rewards-bot` from the final image. Core needs both at startup.
