# Plugin System Overview

Navigation: [Documentation index](./README.md) · [Create a plugin](./create-plugin.md) · [Plugin API reference](./plugin-api.md) · [Official Core plugin](./core-plugin.md)

The bot loads plugins from the `plugins/` directory at startup.

When `plugins/plugins.jsonc` exists, it decides which plugins are active:

- `enabled: true` loads the plugin
- `enabled: false` keeps the plugin installed but inactive
- higher `priority` values load first
- each entry can pass a plugin-specific `config` object
- `source: "marketplace"` marks a plugin installed from the marketplace — it is verified against the signed catalog and runs **sandboxed** (a V8 isolate with no Node APIs)
- `trust: "sandbox"` isolates a local plugin too; `trust: "full"` (**Trusted Mode**) runs it in-process with full access — an explicit, local opt-in for plugins that genuinely need it

The built-in Core plugin lives in `plugins/core/` and is distributed as a proprietary compiled package. Third-party plugins can live beside it and use the same loader, but they use a separate public API.

## What a Plugin Can Do

- register public selector groups
- provide diagnostics
- receive account lifecycle events
- read its own config **and typed settings** (a form the Desk renders from the plugin's `plugin.json`)
- keep a small, scoped **storage** that persists across runs
- show a read-only **panel** (title + stats + lines) inside its card on the Desk Plugins page
- provide non-premium extension points such as diagnostics and notifications

Public plugins cannot register official premium Core tasks or unlock premium entitlements. They also **cannot create new Desk pages** — a plugin's UI is confined to its own panel on the single Plugins page. See the [Plugin API reference](./plugin-api.md#capabilities-settings-storage-panel) for the settings/storage/panel contract.

The official web dashboard is also outside the public plugin contract. It is started by the verified Core bytecode only and is not available to third-party plugins.

## Free and Community Plugins

The bot ships with just the official Core plugin. Every other plugin — free or paid — is installed from the **[plugin marketplace](./plugin-marketplace.md)**: enable it and the bot downloads, verifies, and runs it **sandboxed** on the next start. Browse and install them from the **Plugins → Marketplace** tab in Rewards Desk, or list the catalog from a terminal with `npm run marketplace:list`.

### Example Activation

A marketplace plugin is declared with `source: "marketplace"`:

```jsonc
{
  "cool-plugin": {
    "enabled": true,
    "source": "marketplace",
    "version": "1.2.0"
  }
}
```

The bot fetches it from the signed catalog, verifies its signature and checksum, and runs it in a V8 sandbox. See [Plugin marketplace](./plugin-marketplace.md).

## Managing Plugins

Open **Rewards Desk** (it launches automatically on `npm start`) and go to the **Plugins** page. There you can:

- see every plugin listed in `plugins/plugins.jsonc`
- toggle each plugin on or off (the change is written straight back to `plugins.jsonc`)
- install plugins from the **marketplace** — add a `source: "marketplace"` entry and the bot downloads, verifies, and installs it on the next run (see [Plugin marketplace](./plugin-marketplace.md))
- grant a marketplace plugin **Trusted Mode** (full access) with an explicit per-plugin checkbox — a clear warning is shown first, and enabling a community plugin always warns that it is community-made
- spot the official Core plugin and whether your license unlocks it
- **Publish a plugin** — opens the developer site where you sign in with Discord (no Core license needed) and upload your own plugin
- jump to the guide for building your own plugin

You can also edit `plugins/plugins.jsonc` by hand if you prefer. The bot still verifies the Core bytecode checksum against `plugins/official-core.json` at startup, and every marketplace plugin against the signed `plugins/marketplace.json` catalog.

## How to Learn More

- Read the [Plugin API reference](./plugin-api.md) for exact interfaces and lifecycle hooks.
- Read [Create a plugin](./create-plugin.md) for a small end-to-end example.
- Read [Plugin publishing](./plugin-marketplace.md) if you want to distribute a plugin.
- Read [Official Core plugin](./core-plugin.md) to understand how the paid Core plugin differs from public plugins.
